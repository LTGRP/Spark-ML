# Spark-ML
this project is the implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm in Spark to predict the housing price for next year


Machine Learning Libraries

we are going to implement folowing libraries and compare the prediction. Since this is just a sample, we will never know wheter our prediction is accurate or not.

    1. Decision Tree Regression
    2. Random Forest Regression
    3. Gradient Boosted Tree Regression

1. Decision Tree Regression 
Introduction : Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node (e.g., Outlook) has two or more branches (e.g., Sunny, Overcast and Rainy), each representing values for the attribute tested. Leaf node (e.g., Hours Played) represents a decision on the numerical target. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.
